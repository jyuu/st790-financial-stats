- negative sentiment has a much larger effect on demand and supply than positive sentiment 
- after extreme sentiment, prices become more mean reverting and spreads narrow 
- use social media information to determine portfolio allocations 
- with use of ML tools, now possible to process large amounts of text information about an asset, assign real time investor sentiment scores  based on NLP processing of texts 
- what info can social media provide that is not available from things like newsfeeds?
- do positive and negative sentiment have asymmetric effects on markets? 
- their research shows that social media sentiment does exhibit correlation with liquidity measures ** 
- negative social media sentiment has a larger effect on liquidity measures than positive sentiment 
- A one percent increase in bearish sentiment has 2x as much impact on trading and liquidity than 1% increase in bullish sentiment 
- by using pre-trading measures of sentiment, we find that news and social media data can be used to predict liquidity measures before the market opens 
- by using pre-trading meausres of sentiment, we find that news and social media data can be used to predict liquidity measures BEFORE the market opens
- our event study shows that highly abnormal social media sentiment (at least 3 std deviations above or below average) is preceded by very strong momentum and followed by mean-reverting returns ** 
- high volumes of SM messages are followed by increases in liquidity and return to mean reversion **
- use this to backtest an intraday mean reversion trading strategy that trades in 30 minute intervals 
- every 30 minutes our strategy buys equities that had negative returns, more weight on stocks that had a lot of negative message volume
- this strategy outperforms a benchmark mean reversion strategy that does NOT use social media data 
- our main finding is that there is a much more demand for liquidity, less supply, when social media sentiment is negative than when it is positive
- we use the insights from our regression and event studies to construct an intraday trading strategy that uses ST and TWTR
- since a high volume of social media implies future mean reversion, lower spread ans high liquidity
