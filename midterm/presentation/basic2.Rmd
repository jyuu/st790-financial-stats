# How rebalancing works

- Start with buy-and-hold portfolio 
- Add a short straddle (sell a call and put option)

# Under ideal conditions

- The conditions under which rebalancing returns.. when there is mean reversion 
- when the price underperf

# The problem

# Fixed-weight rebalance of one asset and cash

If we model a single risky asset $P_t$ as follows: 

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{dP_t}{P_t} = \sigma dW_t\\ 
P_t = P_0 \exp{(\sigma W_t - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 t)}
\end{gathered}
$$

And we started with wealth $X_t$ and invested a fixed percentage $m$ into our asset: 

$$
\frac{dX_t}{X_t} = m\frac{dP_t}{P_t}
$$

# Fixed-weight rebalance of one asset and cash

Applying Ito's lemma, we will find that: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
X_t &= X_0 \exp{(m\sigma W_t - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \sigma^2 t)} \\ 
&= X_0 \Big(\frac{P_t}{P_0} \Big)^m \exp{(\frac{1}{2} (m-m^2)\sigma^2 t)} \\
&\approx cX_0 \Big(\frac{P_t}{P_0} \Big)^m
\end{aligned}
$$

# Fixed-weight rebalance of one asset and cash

And a Taylor-series expansion of $X_t$ around $S_t = S_0$: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
X_t &\approx cX_0 \Big[1 + m(\frac{P_t}{P_0}-1) + \frac{1}{2}m(m-1)(\frac{P_t}{P_0}-1)^2 + \text{remainder} \Big] \\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

When $m <1$, we can easily see that our quadratic term has a negative coefficient, giving us the negative convexity property in our payoff profile. 

# Expanding this into a two asset case 

Using the same assumptions as before: 

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \sigma_S dW_{S,t} \quad S_t = S_0 \exp{(\sigma_S W_{S,t} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_S^2 t)}  \\
\frac{dB_t}{B_t} = \sigma_B dW_{B,t} \quad B_t = B_0 \exp{(\sigma_B W_{B,t} - \frac{1}{2}\sigma_B^2 t)}  \\
\end{gathered}
$$

# Fixed-weight rebalance of two assets

Assuming the return correlation between the assets is $\rho$, our wealth at $t$ is then determined by: 

$$
\frac{dX_t}{X_t} = m\frac{dS_t}{S_t} + n \frac{dB_t}{B_t}
$$

Again, applying Ito's lemma, we arrive at: 
 $$
 \begin{aligned}
 X_t &= X_t \exp{(m \sigma_S W_{S,t} + n \sigma_B W_{B,t} - \frac{1}{2}(m^2 \sigma_S^2 + n^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2 \rho m n \sigma_S \sigma_B) t }  \\ 
 &\approx cX_0 \Big( \frac{S_t}{S_0} \Big)^m \Big( \frac{B_t}{B_0} \Big)^n 
 \end{aligned}
 $$

# Fixed-weight rebalance of two assets

Carrying out our Taylor series expansion, we'll find: 

$$
\frac{X_t}{X_0} \approx c\Big[ 1 + m\Big( \frac{P_t}{P_0} -1\Big)  +
n\Big( \frac{B_t}{B_0} -1\Big)  + 
\frac{1}{2}mn\Big( \frac{S_t}{S_0} -\frac{B_t}{B_0}\Big)^2 \Big]
$$

# A solution

Leverage opposing return profile of momentum overlay.

img1 <-  grid::rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(imgs[1])),
                            interpolate = FALSE)
img2 <-  grid::rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(imgs[2])),
                            interpolate = FALSE)

grid.arrange(img1, img2, ncol = 2)

# How momentum works 

They utilized a proprietary moving-average cross-over system. But in general:

```

# How momentum works

High frequency momentum overlay reduce risks induced by rebalancing. The expected profit and loss of the strategy:

$$
\mathbb{E}(PL| P_t) = Y_0 \psi(t) \Big[\log{\frac{P_t}{P_0}}^2 - \sigma^2 t \Big]
$$
